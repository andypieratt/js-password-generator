Random Password Generator

As a user, I want to be able to get a randomly generated password of my choice.

I want to be able to decide if my password includes: (Confirmation Statements)
1. Lowercase characters
2. Upppercase characters
3. Symbols (!@#$%&*+=)
4. Numbers

The length of the users password has to be between 8 - 128 characters...
* What happens if the user doesn't select a numeric value between those parameters? (ALERT notification)
- This will be a boolean (true/false) "if" statement most likely.

If the user answers (false) to all the prompts like Lowercase, Upppercase, Symbols, and Numbers. The program should return no result.

If the user answers (true) to at least one of the prompts, the program should execute and return the user their randomly generated password

Main elements I will need to create this app
1. At least one "prompt" for the user to decide the length of the password.
2. At least four "confirm" statements to learn what types of characters the user wants in their password
3. "if" statements for the "confirm" statements to help the program execute the proper functions for the user
4. A "generatePassword" function that will process the user's responses and return them their password in the text box.
