# js-password-generator

## Objective

The goal of this project was to create a random pass word based off of user information and display it to the user when they click the "generate password" button.

## How I Achieved This

With this challenge we were basically tasked with writing the javascript for the program... minus a few "js" elements that were given to us. I initally went into this assignment very puzzled and just started creating functions, and after talking with a few classmates and consulting some YouTube videos, I realized I was going about this wrong. I did have some of the basic outlines but I probably had 5-6 functions that were unnecessary or basically useless.

Once I took a step back and broke the project into smaller pieces, it started to fly a bit quicker. I began with creating variables and establishing the corresponding arrays of elements for those variables. Once that was created, I began with a series of "if" statements that included the prompts and confirmations that the user will navigate through to get their desired password at the end.

After the prompts were established, I had to figure out how to link the user's answer's with the parameters that I had set and then present that password to the user. So with that, I created a "generatePassword" function within the "js" because the "writePassword" section was calling that function, but it did not yet exist. I then spent some time adding the properties and playing a game of trial and error that eventually led to the finished result.

## How This Applies to My Career

Overall, I really enjoyed this challenge because it was definitely "eye-opening." This was the first challenge that really began to push me and search for resources and help when I got stuck. Thank god for stackoverflow, YouTube, and my classmates or I still probably wouldn't have finished this challenge. However, this assignment shows the usefulness and practicality of javascript and how we as developers or teams can harvest information and responses from the user of our application and then present the user with something they "designed-themselves." I look forward to digging deeper into this realm of programming becqause it really fascinates me.
